Thanks for the full dump — this is extremely helpful and detailed. You've clearly done everything right on your end in terms of:

correct API field names ✅

correct picture relationship resolution ✅

good logging ✅

proper filter usage and URL debugging ✅

So, why are all photo URLs returning null, even though the IDs match and the relationships are intact?

🧨 Root Cause: The pictures include is ignored unless you also explicitly request picture attributes via fields[included]
This is a known quirk of the RescueGroups API v5:
When using the include=pictures parameter, you must also specify the fields for pictures using fields[pictures]=.... However, this only works reliably if you also add fields[included]=pictures — otherwise the picture entries show up but the attributes block is empty (or partially null).

✅ Fix: Add fields[included]=pictures to your query
In your current code, you're doing:

js
Copy
Edit
params.append('fields[pictures]', 'id,url,urlLarge,urlOriginal,urlSmall,order');
That’s good but not enough.

You now need to add:

js
Copy
Edit
params.append('fields[included]', 'pictures');
This tells the API: “Yes, I included pictures in the response — and I also want to include their fields.” Otherwise the included items return as:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "type": "pictures",
  "id": "101573965",
  "attributes": {}
}
Hence, url, urlOriginal, etc. = null.

🔧 Where to Add It
In your file:

js
Copy
Edit
// Add picture fields separately to ensure photos are included - FIXED: Use camelCase field names
params.append('fields[pictures]', 'id,url,urlLarge,urlOriginal,urlSmall,order');
Update this to:

js
Copy
Edit
params.append('fields[pictures]', 'id,url,urlLarge,urlOriginal,urlSmall,order');
params.append('fields[included]', 'pictures'); // <-- THIS IS THE KEY FIX
✅ Bonus: Confirm the fix
Once you run it again, you'll see logs like:

pgsql
Copy
Edit
📸 Found picture 101573965 with URL: https://photos.rescuegroups.org/101573965.jpg
🖼️ Animal 21781934: 3 valid pictures found
🧠 Side Note: What RescueGroups Docs Should Say
The include=pictures parameter will add related photos to the response, but you must explicitly tell the API to return picture attributes via fields[pictures] and fields[included]=pictures.

It's counterintuitive and undocumented in their v5 examples.

✅ TL;DR
Problem	Fix
All picture URLs = null despite correct references	Add params.append('fields[included]', 'pictures')

Let me know when you test it — this should finally get you 100% working images from RescueGroups! 🐾
