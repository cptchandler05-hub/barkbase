✅ AI DEVELOPER PROMPT
Build the /adopt page for BarkBase — the first rescue donation and discovery platform native to web3.
This page must reflect the core mission: rescue visibility, rural inclusion, overlooked dogs first. Barkr, our AI rescue mutt, is the guide behind the scenes.

🧭 OVERALL EXPERIENCE
Create a clean, mobile-optimized /adopt page that feels emotionally urgent, dignified, and Barkr-powered.
The focus is not on what's popular or newest — it’s on what’s most invisible.

Dogs are ranked by a custom visibilityScore.

Higher score = more overlooked.
This score is computed using custom BarkBase logic (e.g. skipped count, time listed, rural ZIP weighting).

The page must never default to popularity or recency. It’s about need and neglect.

🧱 1. HERO SECTION
Headline:
"Adopt the dog they already scrolled past."

Subheadline:
"We don’t show you the most wanted dogs. We show you the ones who still wait."

Button: "Show Me the Most Invisible"
→ On click, trigger Barkr to fetch 10–15 dogs with the highest visibility scores, from rural ZIPs only, using the Petfinder API + calculateVisibilityScore() and getRandomRuralZip() utilities.

Optional Tooltip (Barkr-style):

“These aren’t trending. These are forgotten. That’s why they’re here.”

🎛️ 2. SEARCH & FILTER PANEL
Location input: ZIP or “City, State” (normalized)

Breed: Optional free text or dropdown

Size: S, M, L, XL

Age: Puppy, Adult, Senior

Important rules:

No sort dropdown (we always sort by visibilityScore descending)

No popularity tags, no “featured near you”

If a user doesn’t enter a location, fallback to getRandomRuralZip()

🐾 3. DEFAULT RESULTS (Before User Searches)
Show top 10–15 most overlooked dogs (highest visibility score), pulled from a rotating batch of rural ZIPs via Petfinder API.
This gives users an immediate glimpse into BarkBase’s mission.

🐶 4. DOG CARD DESIGN
Each dog card must include:

Name

First photo

Age, Size, Breed

City, State

🔶 Visibility Score badge (e.g. “Score: 88 – Highly Overlooked”)

Barkr-generated line (e.g. “Skipped 52 times. Still smiling.”)

Button: "Meet [Name]" → links to /adopt/[dogId] page

Optional tags:

“Still Waiting” → Barkr has shown them before

“Rescue Partner” → Rescue is verified BarkBase partner

📄 5. DOG PROFILE PAGES — /adopt/[dogId]
Each dog gets its own BarkBase-hosted page.

Pull and display:

All photos (carousel)

Full description

Breed, age, size, location

Visibility score

Barkr’s analysis (e.g. “Why this dog is overlooked”)

Rescue contact info (if available)

Buttons:

“I want to adopt” → adoption interest form or contact link

“Donate in [Name]’s honor” → sends ETH/USDC tagged to dog/rescue

“Share [Name]” → share to Farcaster, X, Telegram

🚫 Do not send users to Petfinder unless absolutely necessary.
Host everything natively on BarkBase where possible.

🧠 BARKR INTEGRATION (Optional)
Add a small Barkr widget or sidebar:

“Don’t see what you’re looking for? Ask me to find dogs by vibe, size, or place. I don’t just search — I notice what others miss.”

Click → expands Barkr chat window with memory of filters.
