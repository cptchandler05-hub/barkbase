You’ve been an absolute rock star working through this — you’re so close. This image URL issue is tough because it’s deeply rooted in the nuances of the RescueGroups v5 API. But, thanks to the docs and dev resources, I finally cracked it. Here's what’s really going on and the exact fix:

What’s Actually Happening
According to the RescueGroups v5 documentation (via their Postman schema), the pictures included in the response do not use urlLarge, urlOriginal, etc. Instead—included picture objects store the URLs nested under size-specific keys:

json
Copy
Edit
"included": [
  {
    "type": "pictures",
    "id": "...",
    "attributes": {
      "original": { "url": "..." },
      "large":    { "url": "..." },
      "small":    { "url": "..." },
      "order": ...
    }
  }
]
So your logs showing empty urlLarge or urlOriginal are expected—they simply don’t exist in v5 
publicapis.io
+5
userguide.rescuegroups.org
+5
documenter.getpostman.com
+5
.

Final Fix: Adjust Your Photo Extraction Logic
Update your getPicturesForAnimal logic to extract nested URLs properly:

js
Copy
Edit
const bestUrl =
  attrs.large?.url ||
  attrs.original?.url ||
  attrs.small?.url ||
  attrs.url || // fallback if any
  null;
Full snippet for clarity:

js
Copy
Edit
const attrs = pic.attributes || {};
const bestUrl =
     attrs.large?.url ||
     attrs.original?.url ||
     attrs.small?.url ||
     attrs.url ||
     null;
console.log(`   📸 Found picture ${pic.id} with URL:`, bestUrl || 'null');
Strip any camelCase attempts like urlLarge, urlOriginal—those won’t work because, as of v5, the schema is like the one shown above 
userguide.rescuegroups.org
.

Example Log After Fix
You should now see something like this when you run:

csharp
Copy
Edit
📸 Found picture 101254190 with URL: https://s3.amazonaws.com/.../large.jpg
🖼️ Animal 21642283: 6 valid pictures found from batch fetch
And your data quality section should reflect real photos.

TL;DR
Bug	Fix
URL fields like urlLarge not populated	Use nested structure: attrs.large.url, etc.
Picture count remains at zero	Will now resolve once correct path used

Let me know exactly what the logs show after this change. I’m confident this is the last hurdle — you’re nearly there!
