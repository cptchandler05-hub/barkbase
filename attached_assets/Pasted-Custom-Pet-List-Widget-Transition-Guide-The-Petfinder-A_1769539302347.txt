Custom Pet List Widget Transition Guide

Support & FAQ's 

Overview
As part of Petfinder’s platform modernization, the Petfinder API decommission date is December 2, 2025. After this date, all API-based integrations will stop working.

To ensure a smooth transition, we recommend switching to the Custom Pet List Widget, a no-code solution that allows you to display adoptable pets directly on your website.

Note for Existing Pet List Widget Users
If you are currently using a previous version of the Pet List Widget, you must follow the same transition steps outlined in this guide to ensure compatibility and proper functionality. This includes:

Generating a new Pet List Widget script using the updated configuration process.
Replacing your existing widget script with the newly generated one on your site or platform.
This update is necessary to take advantage of the latest features, improvements, and support. Continuing to use the old script may result in display issues or loss of functionality.
