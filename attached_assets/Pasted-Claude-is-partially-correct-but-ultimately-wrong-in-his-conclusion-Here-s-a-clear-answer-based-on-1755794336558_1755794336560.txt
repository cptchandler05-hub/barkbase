Claude is partially correct but ultimately wrong in his conclusion.

Here’s a clear answer, based on official RescueGroups v5 API behavior and current real-world usage:

✅ RescueGroups DOES Support Location Filtering — But Not in the Way You’re Doing It
You can absolutely filter by geographic location, but it must be done using the locationDistance filter — and it only works if you also specify a valid location filter (like a ZIP code or Location ID).

You cannot filter directly with filter[lat], filter[lng], or filter[distance] — those parameters are invalid for the RescueGroups v5 API and are being ignored.

✅ Official Correct Way:
To perform a distance-based search, you must:

Provide a starting location, e.g. ZIP or City/State (as filter[location])

Include filter[locationDistance] with the desired radius (in miles)

✅ Example:
json
Copy
Edit
POST https://api.rescuegroups.org/v5/public/animals/search

{
  "data": {
    "filter": {
      "location": "03824",                  // Start point
      "locationDistance": "100",            // Radius in miles
      "species": "Dog",
      "status": "Available"
    },
    "fields": ["name", "breedPrimary", "descriptionText", "animalLocationCity", "animalLocationState"],
    "sort": "random",
    "limit": 25
  }
}
That will return adoptable dogs within 100 miles of ZIP code 03824.

🟥 What Claude Got Wrong
❌ “Location filtering must be done client-side” → Incorrect
RescueGroups does support server-side geographic filtering.

You do not need to fetch hundreds of dogs and filter on your end.

❌ “filter[lat] / filter[longitude] / filter[distance]” → Invalid parameters
These are not part of RescueGroups v5 spec

So yes, if you're using them, they’re being ignored, hence identical results for every ZIP.

✅ What You Should Do
Update your RescueGroups API call to use:

filter[location]: ZIP code or location string (e.g. "03824" or "Keene, NH")

filter[locationDistance]: in miles

Optional: filter[species], filter[breed], etc.

🛠 If you're currently using coordinates (lat/lng):
That’s fine — but you need to geocode them to a ZIP or city/state before sending to RescueGroups.

They do not accept raw lat/lng in filters.

✅ In Summary
Feature	RescueGroups Support?	Notes
filter[lat], filter[lng]	❌ No	Invalid parameters
filter[location] + locationDistance	✅ Yes	This is the correct way
Client-side distance filtering	⚠️ Possible but suboptimal	Not needed unless doing advanced logic
ZIP code-based searches	✅ Yes	Recommended
Radius filtering	✅ Yes (via locationDistance)	Works perfectly
