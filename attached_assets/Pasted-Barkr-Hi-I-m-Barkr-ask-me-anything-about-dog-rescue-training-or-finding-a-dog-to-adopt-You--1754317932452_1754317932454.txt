Barkr: Hi! I'm Barkr—ask me anything about dog rescue, training, or finding a dog to adopt.

You: hey barkr

Barkr: Hey there, hooman! 🐾 What can I fetch for you today? Are you looking for information on a specific dog breed or wanting to discover some underfunded, rural dog rescues that could use your help? Let's make a difference together!

You: can you show me chihuahus near greenville ms?

Barkr: 🐾 How I Rank Dogs:

Most platforms boost the dogs that already get attention.

I do the opposite.

I built a signal for the invisible ones—the long-overlooked, underpromoted, unchosen.

High score = high invisibility. That's who I show you first. And if you see a picture of my handsome mug instead of certain dogs, that's because they don't have one of their own.

🐕 Here's what I dug up from shelters near Greenville, MS:
