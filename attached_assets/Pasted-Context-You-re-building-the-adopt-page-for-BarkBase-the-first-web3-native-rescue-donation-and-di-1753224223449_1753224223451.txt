Context:
You're building the /adopt page for BarkBase — the first web3-native rescue donation and discovery platform. It is powered by Barkr, an AI dog who surfaces invisible, overlooked, and rural dogs using a custom visibility scoring system. This is not a generic adoption site — the goal is to reroute user attention to dogs who need it most, especially from underfunded rural shelters.

🛠 TASK
Create the /adopt page and associated components based on the following specifications. Do not rely on standard filters or Petfinder UI assumptions. This must be mission-first, visibility-optimized, and tightly aligned with the Barkr experience.

PAGE: /adopt
1. Hero Section (Top of Page)
Large headline:
"Adopt the dog they already scrolled past."

Subheadline:
"We surface the overlooked, the invisible, the rural. Barkr sees what others don’t."

CTA Button:

Label: "Show Me the Most Invisible"

Action: Triggers a fetch of top 10–15 dogs from rural ZIPs with the highest visibility score (using getRandomRuralZip() and scoreVisibility() functions from the backend)

Scrolls user down to results section

Optional: Add Barkr avatar + hoverable tooltip:

“Why are these dogs shown first?” → short blurb about visibility scoring

2. Filter/Search Panel
Location Input: ZIP or City, State (required for precise queries)

Breed Input: Optional free-text or dropdown

Size Filter: Optional (Small, Medium, Large, XL)

Age Filter: Optional (Puppy / Adult / Senior)

DO NOT INCLUDE:

“Newest”

“Trending”

“Popular near me”

3. Default Dog Results (Before Search)
If no filters are used, show:

Top 10–15 dogs with lowest visibility score from a rotating pool of rural ZIPs

Dogs should be sorted using calculateVisibilityScore()

Pull from cached or dynamic Petfinder API data (limit to 100 dogs per fetch, paginate manually)

4. Dog Cards (for all results)
For each dog in the result grid:

Photo (first from array)

Name

Age / Size / Breed summary

Location (City, State)

🔶 Visibility Score badge (composite number or stars)

🧠 Barkr quote (e.g., “Skipped 14 times this week. Still waiting.”)

“Meet [Name]” → opens /adopt/[dogId] internal profile (not Petfinder)

Optional badges:

“Still Waiting” (if this dog was previously shown and not yet adopted)

“Rescue Partner” (if from a BarkBase-partnered rescue)

5. Dog Profile Page: /adopt/[dogId]
Each dog should get a dedicated BarkBase-hosted profile that displays:

All available Petfinder data:
name, age, breed, size, photos, bio, location, contact

Barkr-generated quote or summary

Visibility score + tooltip:
“This dog is in the bottom 10% of adoption visibility nationwide.”

Donation button if tied to a partner rescue (rescueId field present)

“Adopt Me” link only if no direct contact is available or required

Share buttons (X, Telegram, Facebook)

6. Backend Logic / Routing Notes
Use Barkr’s memory and scoring logic (already present in chat/route.ts) for:

Fetching dogs from Petfinder API

Filtering + sorting by visibility score

Choosing rural ZIPs via getRandomRuralZip() utility

cachedDogs should persist dog data across pagination

seenDogIds should prevent duplicates when showing “more dogs”

Visibility scoring is based on:

Days listed

Location remoteness

Photo presence

Breed popularity

Bio length

7. Extra Features (Optional)
“Try another batch” button (refreshes invisible dogs)

Filter: “Only show rescue partners”

Tooltip for each filter:
e.g., “Why can’t I sort by popularity?” → “Because this isn’t a contest.”

8. Design Guidelines
Use clean, humane, emotionally-resonant design

Dog cards should prioritize emotion and mission, not flash

Avoid overloading with UI elements — let the dogs and Barkr speak

Match BarkBase color palette and soft UI styling
